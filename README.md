# TreeTamer
TreeTamer is a C++ library that flattens tree-like data structures (e.g., XML, JSON) into key-value arrays. It recursively traverses trees, converts subtrees into flat structures, and triggers a callback for further data processing. Perfect for data transformation and serialization tasks.
